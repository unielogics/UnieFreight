# UnieFreight – Amplify build spec (Next.js SSR)
# See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/deploy-nextjs-app.html
#
# Important: In Amplify Console, the app must be set to Next.js (SSR) / WEB_COMPUTE.
# If the app is set to "Static" hosting, Amplify will serve .next as static files
# and the site will show "page can't be found".
#
# Env vars (Amplify Console → Environment variables):
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL = https://api.uniewms.com/api/v1 (or your API URL)
